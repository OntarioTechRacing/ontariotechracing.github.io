## 1 Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Ontario Tech Racing: Technical Repos GitHub Page!

This page serves as a central hub for internal technical documentation related
to our team. It encompasses everything from learnings from FSAE-related projects
to internal training documents and guidelines.

A significant portion of this GitHub pages repository integrates documentation
through submodules. This approach helps maintain organization and ensures clear
separation between documents with different purposes.

Quick command to pull changes from remote submodules:
